### My Own Memorygame Built Entirely by Myself (Not Copied in Class)

#### I have decided to build a memory tile game entirely from scratch, as I wasn't going to take credit for the one we copied in class. It took me a good few hours and it definitely tested my new-found knowledge in JS, as well as my patience, but after a night's work I've finished it. As of now it's in its humble embrionic stage. A lot of styling will have to be done on it, but I've done it. It was the child of my brain, and not someone else's. I can proudly showcase it, and claim that I wrote it! 

#####  Off the top of my head I can think of a few things that will need adding/improving:
##### - Styling, definitely! Gonna Add some CSS3 flipping effects to it and remove the shitty production ones I chose to work with.
##### - I'm going to add a step count to it, so it can keep track of how many steps it took the player to complete the game
##### an input box/ dropdown so that the user can pick the (EVEN!!) number of tiles to play with  
##### separating script,style, and html files. I chose to work in one file to keep it relatively simple.
##### clean up my code (remove all console.logs, and self-checks)
